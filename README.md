# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-95-Accuracy-Achieved
In this notebook, we dive deep into a lung cancer survey dataset, exploring the hidden patterns and correlations that could indicate early warning signs. We'll leverage the power of machine learning to build predictive models that can aid in early diagnosis, potentially saving lives.
